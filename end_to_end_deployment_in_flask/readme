End-to-End Deployment of University Dataset Using KMeans Clustering in Flask

Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy a machine learning model using Flask to perform KMeans clustering on a university dataset. It involves:

Data preprocessing and KMeans model training.
Creating a Flask web application to interact with the model.
Deploying the application to a local server.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed.
PostgreSQL: Database system for storing and retrieving data.
Flask: Web framework for creating the web application.
SQLAlchemy: ORM for database interaction.
Joblib/Pickle: For saving and loading the machine learning model.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For KMeans clustering.
Sweetviz: For automated exploratory data analysis.
Kneed: For determining the optimal number of clusters.
